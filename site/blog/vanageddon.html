    About the podcast
  </h2>
  <p>
    Zach and I (Matt) go all the way back to Grade 5 from a small town outside of Medford, OR. We both shared the one and only interest of our youth, Skateboarding. Soon after we met, Zach ended up transferring to a different School a few towns away. So we completely lost contact for about three years. Grade 8 grade rolls around and all of a sudden, we are reunited. From that point on, we developed a everlasting friendship. Hell, we were roommates at one point. Now we both call Washington State home and the friendship is still as strong as it was over a decade ago.
