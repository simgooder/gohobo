Getting out of Sydney for a long weekend and spending it in the countryside is a great way to clear your head, and get back down to earth. With plenty to do if you're a young family, couple or a solo traveller, why not escape the concrete madness? Sip delicious vino overlooking the canola fields that roll into wheat paddocks. Cuddle up in front of a fire and gorge on fresh pizza and belly warming cocktails. Hike to the top of Australia’s largest mountain, and maybe even see snow. Or just relax in the valley and watch the native wildlife in abundance. Rural New South Wales literally has something for everyone

## Young

With so many surrounding towns, and farm life, Young is a wonderful place to come back down to earth. Spend the day sipping on locally grown grapes at [Grove Estate](http://www.visithilltopsregion.com.au/Business-Directory/grove-estate-winery "Grove Estate Winery, New South Wales, Australia"), venture to some of the weekend markets selling fresh produce, honey, and souvenirs. If you happen to visiting during fruit picking, partake in the crazy festivities of Cherry season. Young is also known as the Cherry capital of Australia, and you will soon see why. Drop into some of the local towns nearby with the iconic Wombat a short distance away, or Jugiong 30 minutes drive along the Murrumbidgee River. On your way back to Sydney drop into either Long track Pantry, or Barnestore Emporium for a spot of morning tea before getting on the road.

## Mudgee  

Are you craving a wine? How does a weekend away exploring one of the most peaceful wine regions in Australia sound? Nibble on chip and dip whilst overlooking the beautiful Mudgee area, drop into Logan winery for a drop of Chardonnay, or Skimstone for an incredible Italian Sangiovese. Want to get outside? Head to the Drip Gorge or the Gap Nature Reserve for sensational views of the area. If, after a long day of frolicking around multiple vineyards you find yourself becoming a little peckish, drop by Di’ Lusso Estate for an Italian feast for dinner. If you are looking for somewhere beautiful to stay, look into any of the local [homesteads, or bed and breakfast’s](http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/country-nsw/mudgee-area/mudgee/accommodation "Accommodation in Mudgee, New South Wales, visitnsw.com"). These cute little abodes offer a more realistic depiction of life in the country, and give you that homely feel that you want on short getaways.

## Bathurst

Bathurst is a great place to adventure to if you want a taste of the country, but don't want to loose on out on some city luxuries. It’s a great place for families, or young travellers, with an abundance of activities to keep everyone entertained. Take a brewery tour at Two Heads, and explore beer making, with some tasty treats at the end. Head to [Church Bar](http://www.churchbar.com.au/ "Dinner in Bathurst, New South Wales, churchbar.com.au") for dinner, cuddle up in front of the crackling fire and munch on some delicious pizza. Drive around Mount Panorama like a real V8 driver, or visit the local ice creamery for a diner style experience. Still hungry for adventure? Head to the local caves, drink gin at Four Pillars, eat a healthy breakfast at The Hub, or take a tour of one of the historical locations within Bathurst. Visiting the former Savings Bank, Woolston or Abercrombie house is a great way to finish your time in this quaint old mining town.

## Kangaroo Valley

Bushwalking heaven! This foggy valley South of Sydney is a nature-lover’s dream. With beautiful outdoor walks, kayaking on the river, and the magnificent [Gerringong falls](http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/south-coast/jervis-bay-and-shoalhaven/kangaroo-valley/attractions/gerringong-falls "Tourist attractions, visitnsw.com") you will busy for the whole weekend, without even trying. If you are still lacking your country fix, then drop into the local Pioneer Village Museum and read up on the history of Kangaroo Valley including the amazingly regal Hampden Bridge. Don't forget to make a stop at Tallowa Dam on your way out, part of the supply scheme giving the Shoalhaven area water.
