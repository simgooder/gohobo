Do you like vacations but loathe the travel method of flying? Do you want to enjoy the journey just as much as the destination? Are you thinking of embarking on an adventure that puts you in the Captain’s seat? Maybe renting an RV for your next vacation getaway is the answer you have been looking for. 

Today, travelers are more open about making a journey by black top instead of by air. Being able to have the control to stop and go as you choose. Pull over and try out one of those famous diners that you heard about from a TV show, or stop and see iconic landmarks that you have always wanted to see. Or, maybe it’s been a desire to take the back-roads and see what beautiful landscapes the country has to offer. 

> Renting an RV is like having your own vacation rental on wheels. 

When it comes to traveling by an RV, just pack up and go. Even if you don’t own an RV, finding a unit to rent has never been simpler.  

Here are 5 reasons why you should consider renting an RV for your next road trip.


## 1. Family Time

At the heart of any family vacation, the end result is to create memories. Many travelers will recall the destination as the highlight, especially if you fly. But for those traveling in a motorhome, the road trip is the icing on the cake. Its two adventures in one; the journey and the destination. 

The shoes come off, the passengers sink into the couches and chairs and everyone is riding in comfort. Legs are stretched and family members can feel relaxed. No one has to worry about elbow tucking or sitting awkward while sharing the back seat. No one needs to ask Dad to, “scoot the seat up” while Mom is figuring out creative ways to store the snacks inside the vehicle. Everyone has room and everyone is happy. 

When the family is happy, it’s easier to engage in conversations. The family feels like they started their vacation the moment they stepped inside the RV.

Having a vacation rental on wheels, the journey is up to you. Take advantage of the freedom and discover new places.   


## 2. Life Changing

Traveling by road does a couple things. For starters, you see the world differently. As people, we grow acclimated to the lifestyle and culture of our city or town. Once on the road, we become exposed to a change of pace, seeing new places, people and lifestyles. Even if you are only driving within the same state, new places are new places. 

The second best thing to happen on the road is personal interaction over technology. Whether its business related or personal preference, electronic devices have our undivided attention. Once inside the RV, electronic devices go off and everyone engages with one another. You’ll be surprised the things you learn about each other on the road. 


## 3. Cost Savings

When compared to conventional traveling, renting an RV can save 30%-40% on your vacation when matched against driving your own vehicle, taking into account the money spent on dining and staying in hotel rooms. Of course, the destination and lifestyle will dictate costs, but being able to cook your own meals and stay where you like is where you make your savings. True, the fuel economy of any RV is nowhere near the mileage you would get from a car, but the savings from sleeping and dining in a RV helps offset the expenses you pay for fuel.


## 4. Resorts

RV Resorts are a great way to recharge your batteries. These beautiful and relaxing locations can be found scattered throughout United States. Filled with amenities to make any traveler feel like a king, you’ll think you found a hidden gem when it comes to RV campsites. 

At an RV resort, soak up the sun while reading a good book next to a heated pool. Visit the clubhouse, watch some TV or enjoy a cocktail by the fire. Partake in the daily sponsored activities or attend a special event. There’s no reason to leave the resort, you can enjoy music, fine dining and other on-site attractions that will keep you entertained throughout the duration of your stay. Most even have an on-site store. 

RV resorts are great for all ages and can also be a valuable resourceful, especially if visiting a popular location with high amounts of traffic and tourists. For instance, if you haven’t been to Disneyland theme park in California, it’s hard to find a decent hotel that is close enough to walk, or offers a shuttle service and doesn’t break the bank. 

It’s the same with Las Vegas. Many of the suites in the Casinos are gorgeous, but they are also pricey. If you like to visit these places often and want to save on lodging, there are RV parks located near both areas and offer amazing amenities for your personal enjoyment at a fraction of the price.


## 5. Glamping

You may be asking yourself, “What’s glamping?” Glamping means “glamorous camping.” 

It’s the combination of camping and luxury. Having an RV allows campers to enjoy the great outdoors without sacrificing comfort and convenience.

Travelers can setup camp on the edge of their favorite river while sleeping on a queen sized pillow top bed, in a climate controlled mobile fortress.

Food and meals are easy to manage. Food stays cold and fresh by the built in refrigerator, where meals can be made in minutes thanks to the mobile kitchen. Use the on-board appliances to bake, boil, or even fry your dishes, just like you would at home. With an RV, cooking isn’t limited to a campfire - save that for the S’mores.

Another advantage of camping in a RV is having a bathroom at your disposal. This is especially useful at night. You don’t have to put on shoes and stumble around in the dark. Also, if you get dirty while camping, you can take a shower. 

Finally, camping in an RV means that you can bring the things that mean most and make your experience memorable. For kids, it could be watching movies. For adults, it could be listening to music under the awning while sitting next to the campfire. Glamping is the perfect way for travelers who want to enjoy the outdoors, but still feel at home.
