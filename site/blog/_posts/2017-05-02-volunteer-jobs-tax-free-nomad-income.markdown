Wanna live somewhere wild and cool? Wanna hang a bit, then move on? Wanna make a living? Tax free? Volunteer in US national forests, parks, or other federal lands. Most only ask for a two-month minimum commitment.


## Make Tax-Free Income With Volunteer Work

Vanholio's making a tax-free income right now as a volunteer park host. It's actually enough for me to live on, a bit over $500 per month. (Van life can be dang cheap – if you do it right.)

The job's in a US National Forest. And it's Uncle Sam that pays the bills! (No, I ain't telling you where. Go find your own honey hole!)

Most days, I do 2-3 hours of grunt work max. Then I just hang out and answer questions. It's a beautiful spot, too. I mean, you can't hardly buy real estate like that. Even if you're a billionaire!

### What I GET as a Park Host

- $25 tax-free per diem ($540 per month)
- Free RV site with hookups
- Free propane
- Free WiFi internet
- Free use of government 4WD
- Free use of laundry facilities
- Free snazzy uniform
- Free "America the Beautiful" park pass
- Pride of doing good

### What I DO as Park Host

- Clean bathrooms
- Haul trash
- Mow and trim
- Answer questions
- Yell at kids to behave – BONUS!
- Hand out maps and brochures
- Remind people to pay
- Open and close the gates

  
## Volunteer Jobs Besides Camp Hosting

The national forests, national parks, and other federal agencies have more volunteer jobs than park hosts and camp hosts:
- Maintenance
- Repair backcountry trails
- Plant trees
- Garden
- Staff information booths and visitor centers
- Help out on archaeological digs
- More!
- 
Got a volunteer service idea that isn't posted at [Volunteer.gov](https://www.volunteer.gov/)? Pitch it! Most agencies will consider letting you create your own job, so long as they see the need. Vanholio's gonna propose cleaning up [dispersed campsites](https://freecampsites.net/dispersed-camping/) along the forest roads. Really, you should see the trash people leave behind!


## How to Qualify for a Volunteer Job

As a volunteer, your labor is cheap to free. So naturally, the feds don't ask too many questions. But they gotta ask a few. Mainly, they need to make sure you're not sketchy.

When Vanholio applied, he had to provide a resume, valid ID (driver's license or passport), job application, and three references.


### Can Non-Citizens Get Volunteer Jobs?

Foreigners without work visas can volunteer, but they don't make it worth your while. At least if you care about the benefits.

Non-US citizens need to go through a rigmarole to get a special J-1 visa. It takes months of hoops, including a consulate interview. And after all that, you still won't even give you so much as a free RV pad! It probably ain't worth it unless you really, really wanna help out at Yellowstone or something.


## Find Paying Jobs on Volunteer.gov

Check through the jobs on [Volunteer.gov](https://www.volunteer.gov/). You'll notice that most only give you an RV site with hookups, if that. And maybe propane. But keep looking! Also contact the office that posted a job you like anyway. Maybe all the benefits aren't listed. Don't hurt to ask!
Find Unlisted Volunteer Jobs

Got somewhere you want to volunteer at? Don't see a position with benefits posted? Call the local field, park, or district office and talk to the volunteer coordinator. Maybe they got something that's not posted yet. Maybe they'll create a job just for you!
