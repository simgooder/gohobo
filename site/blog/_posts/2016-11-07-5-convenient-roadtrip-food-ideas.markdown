Last week, I reached out to a few groups of experienced road trippers and found some interesting results. A lot of people are eating fast food on the road. Surprising, I know. Sure it's convenient, but if you ask me, there are so many better options!

In this article, you'll find some go-to snacks when it comes to [road tripping](https://roadtrippers.com/ "Roadtrippers.com"). By process of elimination, we've whittled down a pretty concise and helpful list of tried and tested winners. Believe me when I tell you I've eaten a lot of things in a lot of vehicles. Take that however you like, but soup is not a road-trip friendly food.

## 1. Coffee + Cereal = Winning

You know those cartons of coffee you find in the fridge at the gas station cooler? The packaging claims it's coffee, but it tastes like milk and sugar with some coffee flavour? Incidentally, the carton, when fully opened, makes an excellent cereal bowl. Plus, it's a great time saver for when you just want to hit the road.

This was an absolute staple when I was travelling on a [shoestring budget in Australia](https://nomadsounds.org/2016/09/12/my-great-australian-roadtrip/ "My Great Australian Roadtrip - Nomadsounds.org").

Take a swig, top it off with your favourite hearty breakfast cereal, and you're ready to take on the day.


## 2. Trail Mix and Staying Regular

Road trips tend to be synonymous with bad eating habits. Chips are great, but they're just not filling. Why not be a responsible adult for once in your life and just load up on a good trail mix?

If you stick to the nuts/seeds/dried fruits mix, you'll be able to snack all day without feeling gross, and the best part is there's no need for stealthily wiping your greasy hands all over your friend's upholstery. Plus, nuts/seeds/dried fruits are full of protein, fibre, and minerals! Bonus!

> Consider cracking your eggs outside of your vehicle. In a confined space, the smell of hard-boiled eggs is not the most pleasant.

## 3. Cold Brew (or Cold Tea)

If you're a coffee-nerd like me, and you've really got to have your fresh local roast, finding the right coffee joint in a pinch is not always an ideal situation. I mean, what if you finally get your fix, and it's burnt? Or it's a nasty cup of *Swamp Bean*? Let's face it - 7-11 just isn't going to cut it.

Cold brew is an essential roadtrip fuel for any coffee drinker! Grab a bag of your favourite beans, grind them up (not as small as a pour-over), and set them aside. In a large jar, or jug, or whatever, mix one part grounds, with eight parts water. Let it sit for about 24 hours, strain it out, and you've got a refreshing on-the-go version of your favourite brew.


## 4. Powerful Peanut Butter (or Seed Butter if You're Allergic)

I'm a little biased, as this is my favourite food. Lucky for me, it's quite protein rich, caloric, and filling. It's loaded with good fats, minerals, and vitamins. Peanut butter is also cheap. Even organic, natural peanut butter (just peanuts and salt) is only $5 for a jar. And it's versatile. Maybe the most versatile condiment every created; Peanut butter toast, peanut butter on rice cakes, peanut butter cookies, peanut butter and jam, peanut butter granola bars, peanut butter covered in chocolate, peanut butter mixed with soy sauce, ginger, garlic and chili, peanut butter in my beard...

I think you get the point so we'll leave it at that. Peanut butter for the win!


## 5. Eggs Come Pre-Wrapped

Whether you're on the road, in a hotel, or camping, cooking is not my favourite thing to do under unfavourable conditions. Pre-cooked food to the rescue! 

Hard-boil yourself a few eggs, pack some sea salt and paprika, and you're well on your way. If you don't know how to hard-boil eggs, I'll tell you my secret; Bring the water to a boil, drop eggs in for 12 minutes. When the time's up, move the eggs into a cold water bath, and let them sit for at least 3 minutes. Transferring them between temperatures separates the shell from the edible parts, and makes them super easy to peel when you're ready to eat them. The best part it, eggs come pre-wrapped.

**Bonus road-tip**: Consider cracking your eggs outside of your vehicle. In a confined space, the smell of hard-boiled eggs is not the most pleasant.
