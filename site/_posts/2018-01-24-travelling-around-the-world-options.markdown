If you're seriously considering travelling around the world, there are many ways that you can do so, whether you decide to go with a [group of your friends](https://www.forbes.com/sites/geoffreymorrison/2016/07/31/10-tips-for-travelling-with-friends/#7e9db35d5e60 "Forbes.com - Travelling with friends"), or even just on your own. But before you jet off on your adventures, you need to think about how you're going to pull this off. There are plenty of different options out there, but here are two of the most common options you have. 

## Backpacking: As a solo traveller

A lot of people decide to go backpacking because they think that it's the cheapest option, but one thing you need to know is that most people that set off this way already have a large sum of money that they have been saving up. Just because they aren't staying in the luxury hotels doesn't mean they don't need a lot of money. They are still having to pay for transport to get them from A to B, they are still having to pay for accommodation to make sure they have somewhere safe to sleep at night, and they are still having to pay for food and drink. So bare this in mind. Anyone that decides to start travelling needs to have saved up a decent amount of money - even just for the emergency fund in case things don't go to plan. 

If you don't have a lot of savings then you may be thinking 'I need to look at [loans near me](https://personalloan.co/personal-loans-near-me/ "PersonalLoan.co - Loans near me")', and you could be right. You can get one of these from your bank or the credit union, so get looking around in your area.


## Campervan: As a pair or a larger group

Being your own means of transport is a good idea if you like to explore and have the freedom to go anywhere you want - like backpacking, minus having to rely on other people to get you around. Driving means you can pull over when you wish, take a break, have a nap, and you're safe [inside your own vehicle](https://gohobo.co/journal/why-you-should-live-and-travel-in-a-van-p1/ "GoHobo.co - Why you should live and travel in a van"). Plus this cuts costs down because you aren't having to rely on paying for accommodation because you already have it with you. This is also beneficial because essentially you have a place to put things and keep them stored away without having to worry about it not being secure, whereas if you were backpacking, for example, there's only so much you can take with you from the lack of space. 

If you decide to go with someone else or a whole group, this will end up cheaper as everyone can chip in to pay for fuel. When travelling in a group, you can put your money in together and have one pot for food and drink and one pot for fuel, as well as each person's own personal spending money. That way there's no discussion needed every time something needs to be bought because you've all put the same amount of money in.


Regardless of what decision you make, the most important thing is that you have enough money, and you keep yourself safe. Don't do anything that doesn't feel right - it's just not worth the risk. And also, have fun!
