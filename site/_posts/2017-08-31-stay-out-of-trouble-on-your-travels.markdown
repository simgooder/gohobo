There are lots of people who want to travel and see the world. Perhaps you can, but it is important to realize that traveling can be quite dangerous. Particularly, if you don’t think about where you’re going, what you’re going to do when you get there and how you’re going to afford it. You need to make sure you protect yourself and avoid the danger that comes with travel adventures. Here are some great little tidbits for making sure that your travel dream doesn’t become a terrible nightmare. 


## Have Backups

You are probably [taking money with you](https://gohobo.co/journal/travel-smarter-sharing-economy/) on your travels. It’s best to have a few different sources of money in case you lose one of them or they are stolen. So, you might have a travel currency card with the main portion of your money. But you also want some cash in your pocket which can be useful for tips and other payments related to social etiquette. Finally, you should take a credit card with you. This will provide you with an extra level of security because you will always have enough money to get out of a scrape. It’s worth noting that these financial sources should not be kept in the same place. If you are staying in a hotel with a safe make sure you have some money tucked away for emergencies.

## Take Government Advice

Your government regularly updates the areas of the world that are not safe to travel. There are lots of reasons why an area might be unsafe. It could be in the midst of political upheaval such as Egypt or be a location linked to terrorist activity. Again, Egypt currently fits the bill here and many governments are advising that their citizens don’t travel there at all. You can learn more about parts of Egypt that are not currently safe on [BT Travel](http://home.bt.com/lifestyle/travel/). If you are going to a part of the world that could be considered dangerous, make sure you hire a guide. They will be able to keep you as safe as possible during your trip and make sure you steer clear of dangerous areas.

## Get Full Insurance

You should make sure that you have full travel insurance when you set off on an adventure. It is vital that you are protected for any financial losses and in medical emergencies. At the very least, you should have the medical travel insurance to ensure that you can be treated for any injury or illness that you could experience on vacation. Some people do avoid getting the right travel coverage to cut costs. However, if you explore a site such as [GoBear.com](https://www.gobear.com/ph/travel-insurance), you will see that it is possible to get full coverage without paying a fortune. In fact, you can protect yourself for a fraction of the cost of the holiday.

## Be Honest

When you enter a country, customs and immigration will always ask you about the purpose you have in the country and the activities that you may participate in. If you are as honest as possible, this is the best way to ensure that you do get help from the authorities if things do go wrong. You might also wish to inquire about the rules and laws of the country, armed with the knowledge that they are likely not the same as those of your home nation.
