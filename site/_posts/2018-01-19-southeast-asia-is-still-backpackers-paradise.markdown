For backpackers of all shapes and sizes, Southeast Asia continues to capture their imagination. Sure, Europe and South America are still popular choices, but there is something that keeps drawing people back to countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. To find out just why this is, we are going to talk in more detail about what it is that attracts people to this corner of the world. Of course, everyone’s individual reasons are specific, but there are some which keep coming up time and time again.


## Ease of Travel

For first time travellers, it can be daunting to think about the ways that you are going to get from A to B in a foreign land. However, since so many people come to Southeast Asia, transportation options have opened up all over the place. Of course, the road and rail links are never going to be the same as somewhere like Europe, but this is part of the appeal of travelling to Asia in the first place. Not only is travel easy, it is also very cheap regardless of whether you choose to travel by road, rail or air.


## Fine Food

Each country you visit has its own culinary traditions, and you are truly blessed by choice in this part of the world. Of course, there are plenty of fine restaurants to choose from, but you are also just as likely to enjoy a fantastic meal at one of the many streetside establishments. One of the great joys of food in Southeast Asia is just how colourful and flavourful it is. When you are out here, make sure that you try as many different options as you can to get a full picture of it.


## Affordability

Many backpackers travel with a [strict budget](https://www.goatsontheroad.com/how-much-will-south-east-asia-cost/ "Goats on the road.com") in mind that they want to stretch out as much as possible. Thankfully, Southeast Asia is the kind of place that you can budget a few dollars a day and still enjoy a great standard of travelling. This means that you can take a much longer trip than you would otherwise be able to in different parts of the world. However, you still need to be on your toes as some people will try to take advantage of your financial naivety by overcharging you for things.


## Stunning Scenery

Whether is it is the rising karst cliffs in Vietnam’s [Halong Bay](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/vietnam/northeast-vietnam/halong-bay "LonelyPlanet.com/vietnam") or idyllic sandy beaches on one of the Thai islands, Southeast Asia is home to some spectacular scenery every way you turn. The year-round warm weather means that you are able to enjoy the landscapes whenever you choose to pay a visit to this part of the world. For maximum pleasure, go when it is winter back home and you can truly appreciate how far away you are from the cold weather.


## Major Cities

If you are more of a city-dweller, Southeast Asia is home to some of the most fast-paced and electric metropolises in the world. Just some of them include Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City and Kuala Lumpur. Within these places, you will see eastern and western traditions combined in a way unlike anywhere else. Just around the corner from a street of towering skyscrapers, you will find ancient and peaceful temples. The contrast of the modern and the traditional is something else you will notice about many Southeast Asian cities.


## Expat Community

Whichever country you visit, you will find an expat community who have fallen in love with the Asian lifestyle and have chosen to make this continent their home. If you can get in touch with locals, they will be able to show you an entirely different side of the country. The affordability of the lifestyle and accommodation in places like [https://rumahdijual.com/cirebon/](https://rumahdijual.com/cirebon/) make it more than possible to start a new life here. Who knows, you may even get drawn in yourself!


## Long History

A lot of ancient societies began in Southeast Asia, and many remnants from the past are a testament to this. The most obvious example is the dazzling temple of Angkor Wat and the surrounding monuments which make up this huge protected zone. Of course, much of the region went through a much more troubled modern [history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVITTpIiXyE "YouTube.com - The History of Southeast Asia: Every Year"), and there are plenty of reminders of events like the Vietnam War, the destructive and brutal rule of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, and the extreme bombing of Laos. In countries like Burma, the political situation still remains very unstable and volatile.


## Cultural Contrasts

Another major reason why western backpackers like to travel to Southeast Asia is just how different the culture is. You are highly unlikely to be so amazed if you simply travel to Europe or [Australia](https://gohobo.co/journal/awesome-australia-6-best-cities/), though both destinations obviously have their appealing factors as well. Within the region, there are a variety of different cultures existing side by side, all offering their own traditions, languages, fashions and customs. Even as modern life continues to sweep through the region at a rapid pace, a lot of the population are still passionate about upholding their historical rituals and practices.


## Premier Partying

For many young backpackers in particular, the opportunity to enjoy the nightlife is one of the main draws of going backpacking in this area. The majority of the cities in the region will offer plenty of bars and clubs which are specifically geared towards young people. The Thai islands are particularly popular destinations, and most people put going to a [Full Moon Party](https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Attraction_Review-g303907-d4020022-Reviews-Full_Moon_Party-Ko_Pha_Ngan_Surat_Thani_Province.html "Tripadvisor.ca - Full Moon Party") high up on their list of must-do activities. 


## Simple Solitude

If you are the kind of person who isn’t that keen on wild parties full of people, there are plenty of places where you can enjoy a more solitary travelling experience. Essentially, you want to look which destinations are on the main backpacker’s trail and head off in the opposite direction. For example, there are plenty of [hill tribes](https://www.wheresidewalksend.com/thai-hill-tribes-debate "WhereSidewalksEnd - Thai Hill Tribes"/) up in the north of Thailand which have not had a great deal of contact with the outside world. Though travelling around this area may be more challenging, it will be worth it to escape the crowds.


## Friendly People

One of the most noticeable aspects of visiting any part of the world is the type of people who call this area home. Even though many of these people have gone through unimaginable hardships in their lives, you may well be surprised by just how many smiling, open, and happy people you encounter. There is a general sense of optimism and openness which pervades this area. Make sure that you really take the time to speak to the people here to get the best understanding of the region that you can.


## Rapid Change

Obviously, the whole world is changing at an extremely rapid rate, but the speed of change seems to be especially noticeable in Asia. The population boom, advancement in technology and foreign influence have all hit at a similar time, and it is difficult to say where things are heading next. Visit Southeast Asia now and you are bound to see a completely different place in a few years time.


So, these are just a few of the reasons why Southeast Asia continues to have that enduring sense of popularity and appeal amongst all kinds of backpackers. There are plenty more draws that bring people to this area, but the affordability, ease of transport, stunning scenery, glorious weather, and friendly people are all high on most people’s list.
